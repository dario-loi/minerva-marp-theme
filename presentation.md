# Introduction

2. The design is clean, modern, and professional.
3. It's easy to use and customize.

## Key Features

You can use standard Markdown syntax to create your slides.

### Links and Blockquotes
You can add links like this one to the [Sapienza website](https://www.uniroma1.it/en).

> Blockquotes are great for emphasizing a key point or citing a source. They are styled with the Sapienza red accent color.

---

## Code Blocks

The theme includes styling for both inline and block code snippets. Here is an example of a Python code block:

```python
def main():
    """Prints a welcome message."""

    if 4 >= 3: # With ligatures!
        print("Welcome to my presentation!")

    

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

# Integrated MathJax Support

You can include mathematical expressions using LaTeX syntax. For example, here's the triangular number formula:

$$
T_n = \sum_{k=1}^{n} k = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
$$
